# Agricultural Production Optimization with Dash

## Overview
This project is an interactive web application built using **Dash** that leverages machine learning models (Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost) and clustering algorithms (KMeans) to optimize agricultural production. The app visualizes key insights, evaluates classification models, and explores the data using clustering techniques. 

It is designed to help agricultural businesses make data-driven decisions and improve efficiency by analyzing agricultural data.

## Features
- **Data Visualizations:**
  - Demonstration relationship between features and each other.
  - Visualizion the distribution of each feature.

- **Classification Models:**
  - Comparison of **Random Forest**, **SVM**, and **XGBoost** classifiers.

- **Clustering Models:**
  - **KMeans** clustering with 3D visualization using PCA to reduce dimensionality.

- **Interactive Interface:**
  - Select models, view metrics, and interact with visualizations.
